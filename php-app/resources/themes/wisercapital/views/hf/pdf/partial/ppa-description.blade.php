    The below numbers are based upon a preliminary review of the site and our investors' 
    return requirements. These numbers may change should formal agreements not be executed 
    within two weeks and market forces necessitate financing adjustments. After a formal site 
    walk, the exact system size will be confirmed and updated numbers will be provided.

    This proposal is for a {{ $site->getTerm() }} year PPA with solar electricity rates at 
    {{number_format($site->getEsc(), 2)}}<small>&#37;</small>   escalation for the duration of the PPA. 
    Typically utility rates increase 3<small>&#37;</small> annually, hence the increased annual savings over time.

    Per IRS rules, {{$site->name}} would have the option to buy the system after year six at Fair Market Value. 
    Estimated buy out price will be based on the future value of the PPA, discounted 10%. In accordance 
    with IRC ยง338(b) (5), the actual buy out price will be determined at the time of purchase, as the 
    "greater of" the discounted future value of the PPA or the Fair Market Value (FMV) of the system 
    based on its remaining useful life and appraised at the time of purchase. No one can currently guarantee
    the FMV that will be assigned in the future, therefore the discount rate on the future value of 
    the PPA has been provided as the estimated buy out price.
